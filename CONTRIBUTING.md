# Contributing Guide

## Please Read
If you would like to contribute, please keep the following in mind:
 - If you make a change that affects the setup (ex. Adding a new custom slot type), make sure you're updating the README file.
 - If you make a new intent, make sure that you follow the same syntax as the rest of the templates. DO NOT just put English text in `alexa.py` file.
   - Make sure you look at the translating guide below to get your intent ready for translation.

## Needs
 - Translation help! If you are a native German speaker, please help with staying on top of new intents and responses. Look at the translating guide below to get setup.
 - New features and refactoring. Please test all code extensively before you commit.

## Translating
There are two main areas translation needs to happen. The sampleUtterances and templates files. Translation should be pretty straight forward.
